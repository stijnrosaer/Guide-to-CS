## Report

We decided on the content and dates of our sessions. Each session has one or more people responsible for it. This just means they are the one(s) making sure everything is prepared for that session in time. We also discussed an extra session about latex.

#### 1. Introduction + reception  <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">24/09/2018 (week 1)</span> <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">Stijn</span>
This will stay the same as last year.

Stijn:
- Updating outdated links
- Shopping for reception

Toon:
- Cups for food and drinks

Senne:
- Shopping for reception


#### 2. Dual boot + virtual box <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">27/10/2018 (week 1)</span> <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">Senne</span>
This session will be given in two groups on Friday morning.
Stijn will send a link with the correct 18.04 LTS ISO file to the other group members. Everyone brings their own laptop to create the bootable USB-drives. If spare USB-drives are available, bring them.

 - Group all people with a hybrid hard drive, this is a higher risk
 - Make it explicit that a mac should not be dual booted
 - Create Facebook post beforehand stating following things:
   * Bring USB with 8GB or more. It should be empty.
   * Make a backup + disclaimer, but not too scary.
   * The session might run late if problems occur.
 - Students with problems are welcome at noon
 - Create a feedback form students can fill in after the session so that we get an idea about which problems occur and what solutions were applied. Depending on the results of this study, we can improve our workflow next time.

#### 3. Dot + git <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">After exam GAS</span> <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">Mateo + Arno</span>
Due to the complexity of the session last year, this one has to be simplified to the essentials that are needed for GAS, T&A, ... . Also show a more advanced solution of what is possible with Dot-code. Starting with an explanation followed by a small exercise (maybe a follow along style one) that is finished in a short amount of time

For the second part of the session, the simple use of GitHub in PyCharm is shown.
First we help them create an account and enroll them form a student pack. __ Make sure that the remarks of Tom are followed __


#### 4. Git <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">First week of second semester</span> <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">TBA</span>
We start with a very high level presentation about what Git can do and why students should use it. This is followed by a well motivated demonstration. Then the students are paired (2 students per group) and collaboratively learn Git on their own through an exercise sheet which explains the basics of Git alternated by a small exercise for each command.
A mail should be send to [Glenn Daneels](mailto:glenn.daneels@uantwerpen.be) to ask for the paper versions of the GitHub cheat sheet.

The explanations and exercises are completed and improved by Stijn, Senne and Toon.

#### 5. Latex <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">TBA</span> <span style="background-color:grey;border-radius:5px;margin-left:50px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">TBA</span>
This is a new session. Content has to be made if useful.
